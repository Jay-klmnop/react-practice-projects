    author: "Tiffany Skinner",
    text: `When you’re in the ring, you’re going to get hit – it’s the nature of the sport. Regardless of how skilled you are or how fast you are, at some point you are going to get hit. It’s how you respond that matters. How we react internally and externally in that split second can be the difference between winning or losing.

    text: `For nonreaders, life is simply what they touch and see, not what they feel when they open the pages of a play and are transported to the Forest of Arden or Illyria. Where the world is full of a thousand colors for those who love books, I suspect it is simply black and gray to everyone else. A tree is a tree to them; it is never a magical doorway to another world populated with beings that don’t exist here.`,
